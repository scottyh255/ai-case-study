# ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd5a2c20-a67e-4e9c-bdc2-62344d88df0c)
# Founded in 2002
# The company was founded by Scott M. Smith, Ryan Smith, Jared Smith, and Stuart Orgill.
# Scott M. Smith from BYU, originally came up with the idea behind Qualtrics. He needed a tool that could conduct academic research, but he wanted to simplify the process. His son, saw the potential of this idea beyond academia, leading to the creation of Qualtrics as a platform that allows organizations to conduct online surveys, gather data, and create insights. The platform was designed to make complex data collection and analysis accessible, enabling businesses and institutions to leverage data for decision-making.
# Qualtrics has received substantial funding over the years. In 2012, it raised its first round of external funding and has raised approximately $400 million from investors. Some of their key investors include Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital, and Insight Venture Partners. Qualtrics went public in January 2021 and later became a subsidiary of SAP, although it was spun off as a separate public company again in 2021.

## Business Activities
# Qualtrics helps businesses understand and improve how they interact with their customers. Qualtrics provides tools that make it easier to collect feedback from customers and employees, understand what it means, and take actions that improve satisfaction and loyalty.
# Their main customers are businesses of all sizes, from small companies to large corporations, as well as government agencies and schools. Basically, any organization that wants to better understand and improve the experiences of their customers or employees can use Qualtrics.
